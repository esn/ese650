1. the train and test data should be put one directory above the code directory
2. run proj3_train.m to train. Or you can omit this step because the model is saved in a matfile
3. run proj3_test.m to test
Notes:
I first used matlab's hmmtrain and hmmdecode to train and test the model.
After it worked, I tried to implement the forward and backward and Baum-welch myself.
which is in hmm_train and hmm_decode. I used some of matlab's code in my own version,
because there are just some parts that I couldn't figure out myself.
