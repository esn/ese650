There are 3 major classes that I use for this project
1. GMM which is basically a wrapper class for gmdistribution to train a gaussian mixture model on different features like green, sidewalk, road and roof.
2. MDP is a markov decision process that takes in an image and generate state action paris and feature matrix. Two major methods are addPolicy and remove Policy.
3. LEARCH is the learning to search framework which takes in a bunch of train mdp and test mdp. It trains on the train mdp and test on the test mdp or any other mdp that you put throuth the learch.test method
