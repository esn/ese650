For running this project, you need to make sure
1. Compile libicp in 3rdparty
2. put log.mat file in data folder
3. run proj6_main.m

There are two major classes I wrote for this project
1. PoseNode
2. GraphSlam
Both of them are heavily documented and there should be no difficulty in reading
and understanding them.

I also include ls-slam, which is an implementation from G. Grisetti for his class.
The data set he used is g2o format. I'm planning to convert my GraphSlam class to
read g2o dataset.
